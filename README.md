## What is Classical Programming?

Classical programming is my approach to ad-fontes learning of programming languages. The method is designed to be minimal, focusing on essential concepts in a short, concise format. Each language is introduced with a **120-second visual example** that highlights key ideas. After the visual example, I dive into **implementation**, followed by **exercises** and **reading materials** for reference. 

The goal is to provide enough context to understand the core of each language without overwhelming you with details. The process is still being refined, and the journey continues to evolve as I build more resources.  

## Language Journey  

Below are the repositories that house my journey through classical programming in different languages. Each one is a collection of minimalistic, hands-on learning experiences.  

#### Specialized Languages  
- **[Classic HTML](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-html)** - Status: Not Started  
- **[Classic CSS](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-css)** - Status: Not Started  
- **[Classic LaTeX](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-typescript)** - Status: Not Started  
- **[Classic R](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-scala)** - Status: Not Started  

#### Low Level Languages  
- **[Classic C](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-c)** - Status: In Progress  
- **[Classic Assembly](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-assembly)** - Status: Not Started  

#### High Level Languages   
- **[Classic JS](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-js)** - Status: Not Started  
- **[Classic Python](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-python)** - Status: Not Started  
- **[Classic TypeScript](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-typescript)** - Status: Not Started  
- **[Classic Scala](https://github.com/krisyotam/classic-scala)** - Status: Not Started  

Each language repository will include brief visual examples, code implementation, exercises, and links to further reading to deepen understanding.  

## Progress
